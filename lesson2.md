# Lesson 2: One-to-One Unidirectional Relationship

## Overview

We have a `player` table which stores the basic information about the player like id and name and a `player_profile` table which stores the additional details like the social media accounts of the players.

There is a __one-to-one relationship__ between `player` and `player_profile` tables and in this lesson, we will model it as a __one way/unidirectional relationship__.
